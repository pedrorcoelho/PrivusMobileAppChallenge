# PrivusMobileAppChallenge

Voip App for Privus Challenge.

This app features a contact's list and a call history.
Contact synchronization is automatic and can be disabled.
On automatic mode, it will synchronize the device's contacts every time the app is started and if a contact is manually deleted it will not be fetch again.
Automatic synchronization can be disable and the user can force a new synchronization at any given moment.
On clicking on a contact, the options are "call", "edit" and "delete".
Only contacts featuring a "voip number" can be called.
There's also a "only voip" filter, to display only contacts that feature a "voip number".
Dummy data can be added for testing, under the top right options button.
Also, all contacts can be deleted, as well as the call history.
Contacts are always displayed by alphabetical order, and call logs by most recent first.
On contacts that do not have an profile image, the contact's initials are used in the contact's avatar.
